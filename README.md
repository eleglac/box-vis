# box-vis

A visualizer for stock options data, built on Clojure and Quil.  Currently a WIP; the eventual goal is for it to be an interactive web applet.

TODOs (in reverse order):
- Refactor core.clj into smaller pieces

## Usage

At the moment, it's best run from a repl:

`(apply q/sketch sketch-settings)`

## License

I haven't picked one yet, but for right now you can use this code for personal noncommercial purposes and no other.
